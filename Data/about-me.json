  "aboutMe": "Hi! My name is Pawel Jaromin, and I aspire to become a Web Developer. One day I decided I would like to create my application, and that's how it all started, from HTML and CSS to JavaScript and Vue. Currently, I'm engaged in creating a website for HomeyGoat Miniature Painting Studio. Besides that, I'm building custom projects to improve my knowledge and skills to create the best possible user experience and maintainable code I can achieve. Until now, I had a chance to work with programming languages(HTML, CSS, JavaScript), tools (Vuelidate, GSAP) and frameworks (Vue.js), which only have boosted my interest in this field. I have started learning Node.js to grasp a little understanding of what is going on from the server side so I could hopefully make use of it. But mainly, I would like to focus on developing skills to fluently operate with animations hence my interest in GSAP and, when I get it under control, start with Anime.js."
