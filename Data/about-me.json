  "aboutMe": "Hi! My name is Pawel Jaromin. I grew up in Poland, and currently, I'm living in the Netherlands for a few years now. I'm a hard worker and genuinely like to learn. When the possibility arises, I like to pack my backpack and fly to a yet unknown to me place. But for some time, my main interest lies in coding. One day I decided I would like to create an application that would help split the bill, and that's how it all started, from HTML and CSS to JavaScript and Vue. Creating new projects, looking for new solutions and challenging myself delivers a lot of satisfaction. I'm steadily developing that passion every day, and hopefully, it will continue. In the future, I would like to focus on animations with help of anime.js and Three.js to boost interactiveness and users experience as much as possible."
